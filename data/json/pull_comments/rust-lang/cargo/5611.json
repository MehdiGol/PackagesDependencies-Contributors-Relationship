I'm pretty excited to see this start moving and I'm also excited that cargo-edit has come so far!\r\n\r\nIt looks like some of the integration points are still missing here in terms of being a mergeable PR, but in general it may also be worthwhile to discuss integration strategies. First off I'm personaly in favor of merging cargo-edit into Cargo now if it has a style-preserving TOML parser, that's all we were waiting for! Second, though, I think we'll want to integrate the project into Cargo's codebase in an idiomatic fashion with Cargo's own code (aka errors and such).\r\n\r\nI think for integration though we'll also want to try to avoid having two TOML parsers (if we can). I'd ideally like to keep everything on the same parser if we can to help reduce bugs and such. For example it looks like `toml_edit` is using a nom-based parser, but perhaps [`tokens.rs`](https://github.com/alexcrichton/toml-rs/blob/master/src/tokens.rs) could be exported and/or extracted to a crate and shared between the two?\r\n\r\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/comments/401938287", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5611#issuecomment-401938287", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5611", "id": 401938287, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTkzODI4Nw==", "user": {"login": "ibaryshnikov", "id": 9951788, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk5NTE3ODg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9951788?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ibaryshnikov", "html_url": "https://github.com/ibaryshnikov", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ibaryshnikov/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ibaryshnikov/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ibaryshnikov/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ibaryshnikov/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ibaryshnikov/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ibaryshnikov/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ibaryshnikov/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ibaryshnikov/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ibaryshnikov/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2018-07-02T21:13:35Z", "updated_at": "2018-07-02T21:31:42Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "Thank you for the explanations, @alexcrichton !\r\n\r\nI've just replaced ErrorKind errors with format_err macro.

I'm happy to help to make this happen.\r\n\r\n> For example it looks like toml_edit is using a nom-based parser, but perhaps tokens.rs could be exported and/or extracted to a crate and shared between the two?\r\n\r\nActually `toml_edit` uses `combine`-based parser. I can hack over this weekend to extract and reuse tokens.rs if it helps.
