The Rust team is excited to review your changes, and you should hear from @matklad (or someone else) soon.\n\nIf any changes to this PR are deemed necessary, please add them as extra commits. This ensures that the reviewer can see what has changed since they last reviewed the code. Due to the way GitHub handles out-of-date commits, this should also make it reasonably obvious what issues have or haven't been addressed. Large or tricky changes may require several passes of review and changes.\n\nPlease see [the contribution instructions](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/comments/427152985", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6133#issuecomment-427152985", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6133", "id": 427152985, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzE1Mjk4NQ==", "user": {"login": "chmanchester", "id": 1058680, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTg2ODA=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1058680?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chmanchester", "html_url": "https://github.com/chmanchester", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chmanchester/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chmanchester/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chmanchester/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chmanchester/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chmanchester/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chmanchester/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chmanchester/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chmanchester/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chmanchester/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2018-10-04T20:10:44Z", "updated_at": "2018-10-04T20:10:44Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "@mshal this is the change I mentioned that will let us simplify some of the things we added for the tup backend and build scripts, let me know if you have any feedback here!"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/comments/427237999", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6133#issuecomment-427237999", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6133", "id": 427237999, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzIzNzk5OQ==", "user": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2018-10-05T03:49:38Z", "updated_at": "2018-10-05T03:49:38Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "Looks good to me!
