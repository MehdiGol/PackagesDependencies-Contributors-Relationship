Looking at this again I'm sort of faced again though with conflicts about how much this'll help us. I've never really enjoyed filling out templates myself on other projects in that my bug/feature request never really fits in and it doesn't seem to assist the resolution of the issue in the long run.\r\n> \r\n> Can you describe again the thinking behind adding these? E.g. what's the main expected benefit for us?\r\n\r\nSo, first off, from https://blog.github.com/2018-05-02-issue-template-improvements/ it looks like this setup will give you the option to use one of these templates, but *also* the option to \"Open a regular issue\", so opt-ing out is kind of a visibly accepted option.\r\n\r\nBut going back, the motivation behind this was a conversation about the state of the issue tracker and good quality issues in the backlog, and I proposed trying out GitHub's new issue template, now with multiple template support too.\r\n\r\nThe thinking (or at least my take on it) is that if you guide issue authors into nicely capturing the requested feature or the reported bug, along with the status quo at the time, *on average* you end up with a better quality issue backlog.\r\n\r\nIn particular (as mentioned above) guiding ticket authors to distinguish their proposed solution (for a feature/bug/enhancement) from the underlying problem they're attempting to solve, has great value."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/comments/428324003", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6147#issuecomment-428324003", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6147", "id": 428324003, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODMyNDAwMw==", "user": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2018-10-09T19:40:42Z", "updated_at": "2018-10-09T19:40:42Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "I think I'm sort of torn on this. I agree that with a template we're likely to increase the quality of bug reports. That being said though I feel that the increase in quality isn't really significant enough for maintainers of Cargo. Put another way, those already familiar with Cargo are unlikely to benefit from the issue templates (I think). In that light, the slight net negative of maybe some reports are lost seems like it would lead to us not wanting to do this.\r\n\r\nMaintainers aren't the only users of issues though! If we have a large \"triage community\" or set of folks who aren't so intimately familiar with Cargo then having higher quality issues could in theory have a significant impact on them. I don't think we have much of a set of folks here (no, not you @dwijnand, you know enough of Cargo's internals now you're maintainer level :P), but would could definitely use folks like that!\r\n\r\nI suppose like many other features we could try this out and see how it goes? In doing so though perhaps we could do so a little more conservatively, perhaps only having feature requests and bug reports, and small (maybe commented out by default) blurbs about each issue. Emoji in the template by default could also be useful to visually distinguish the two as well I think?"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/comments/428484013", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6147#issuecomment-428484013", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6147", "id": 428484013, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODQ4NDAxMw==", "user": {"login": "dwijnand", "id": 344610, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDYxMA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/344610?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand", "html_url": "https://github.com/dwijnand", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2018-10-10T08:28:08Z", "updated_at": "2018-10-10T08:28:08Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "Some adaptation pushed (I only had limited time today to think about it much), and also added this to the meeting agenda to discuss. \ud83d\ude42"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/comments/428715334", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6147#issuecomment-428715334", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6147", "id": 428715334, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODcxNTMzNA==", "user": {"login": "joshtriplett", "id": 162737, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjczNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/162737?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett", "html_url": "https://github.com/joshtriplett", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2018-10-10T20:16:31Z", "updated_at": "2018-10-10T20:16:31Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "I'll try to respond in more depth later, but overall, I think the idea of issue templates is a good idea (e.g. asking for version information and steps to reproduce), but I feel like the default templates don't fit very well for us and are a bit too structured."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/comments/428735375", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6147#issuecomment-428735375", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6147", "id": 428735375, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODczNTM3NQ==", "user": {"login": "dwijnand", "id": 344610, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDYxMA==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/344610?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand", "html_url": "https://github.com/dwijnand", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dwijnand/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2018-10-10T21:17:54Z", "updated_at": "2018-10-10T21:17:54Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "r?
