I suspect that at least on windows we could avoid adding the sysroot to `PATH` as being in the same cwd as `rustc.exe` should make it not necessary. I forget now at this point why we do it for other platforms, but I think it has something to do with build scripts, for example, linking to `proc_macro` which is a dynamic library.\r\n\r\nIn that sense we can probably avoid doing this for all `rustc` invocations, but I think we may need to continue to do so for other non-rustc invocations? (the handling of dynamic library lookup paths is a bit of a mess...)"}]
