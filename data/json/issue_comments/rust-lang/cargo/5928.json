They're not super well indexed unfortunately. Cargo unions all features which means with `--all` it would union all the features requested by anything, and a different bug means that Cargo never compiles multiple versions of a crate with different sets of features meaning that a crate is only compiled once with one set of features.\r\n\r\nIn that sense it's not compatible with features today in Cargo to have a set of binaries that only work with a feature and a set that only work without, and then build them all at once."}]
