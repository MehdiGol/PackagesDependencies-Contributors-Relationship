I do regret at this point at least not having a comment at the top saying it's automatically generated. FWIW historically changing the lock file encoding is somewhat difficult because we don't want to roll it out immediately causing stable/nightly cargos to thrash on what the lock file should look like. In that sense the implementation here would take awhile to stabilize, but would look like:\r\n\r\n* Implement support in Cargo to preserve the comment at the top of the file. That is, if Cargo sees a comment at the top of a lock file, it preserves it.\r\n* Let this support ride the trains and bake on stable for a release or two\r\n* Update Cargo to emit a comment by default at the top\r\n\r\nI think we can definitely figure out how to craft a comment that covers popular systems like GitHub, Phabricator, GitLab, etc, to automatically flag the file as generated.\r\n\r\n@dwijnand would you perhaps be interested in kicking off the implementation here?"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/comments/430719932", "html_url":
