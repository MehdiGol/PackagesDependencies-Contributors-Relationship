We discussed this during the @rust-lang/cargo triage meeting yesterday, and I'm going to try to do my best to summarize the result of the discussion.\r\n\r\nThe main aspect that we concluded was that we view it as quite valuable to, in an automated fashion, poke issues to try to keep them moving forward. This is a great way for the team to be reminded about older issues (as well as contributors). This not only provides an opportunity for someone to realize that the issue has been fixed by something else but it also provides a great time to refresh the context to make sure the bug is up to date.\r\n\r\nThere was not consensus amongst the team about the usefulness of automatically closing issues if they had been stale for awhile. We all agreed, however, that many of the points brought up here were agree that we don't want to happen. For example we do not want to portray the message that if an issue is automatically closed that it will be forever closed. Furthermore we don't want to irritate ourselves or contributors by constantly fighting to keep a legitimate issue open.\r\n\r\nWith all that in mind, and in addition with the experience we've learned over the past weekend, we concluded that this is the steps we'd like to take at this time:\r\n\r\n* We've [updated](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6058) the bot's configuration to slow down even more. Although 24 issues per day is as slow as the bot can go, we felt it was still too fast. We've increased the time it takes for an issue to be considered as \"stale\" (to three years) to only have a handful of issues be considered for being stale.\r\n* We've also updated the amount of time given until an issue is automatically closed, now to 30 days. We're in no rush to close a stale issue, and we want to make sure that if an issue is closed that it truly is stale with very little interest!\r\n* We're [looking for feedback on wording](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6058) of the message to clearly imply that the main purpose is poking the issue to help it move forward. We don't want the focus to be that this is closing and it's a race against the clock.\r\n* We won't decrease the amount of time to the first poke by the bot until we can figure out how to execute at a slower rate than 24/day. This may require changes to the bot upstream, however.\r\n* We'd love to get some feedback on labels that turn off the bot. For example right now all issues tagged as a feature request will not be poked by the bot. Are there other labels to add too?\r\n\r\nOthers from the @rust-lang/cargo team can feel free to chime in here too!"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/comments/423339602", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6035#issuecomment-423339602", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6035", "id": 423339602, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzMzOTYwMg==", "user": {"login": "SimonSapin", "id": 291359, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTM1OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/291359?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin", "html_url": "https://github.com/SimonSapin", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SimonSapin/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2018-09-20T21:28:40Z", "updated_at": "2018-09-20T21:28:40Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "> we don't want to irritate ourselves or contributors by constantly fighting to keep a legitimate issue open.\r\n\r\nMaybe the lower frequency will make this less irritating, but it\u2019ll keep happening."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/comments/423340762", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6035#issuecomment-423340762", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6035", "id": 423340762, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzM0MDc2Mg==", "user": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2018-09-20T21:32:42Z", "updated_at": "2018-09-20T21:32:42Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "@SimonSapin that's true, yes, but if truly nothing happens on an issue for literally years on end I think asking someone to say (like once a year) that the issue still exists is quite reasonable.
