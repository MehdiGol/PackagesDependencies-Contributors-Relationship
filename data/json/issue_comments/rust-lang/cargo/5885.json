Right now there's not a great answer here in that Cargo doesn't have anything implemented to do something like this nor does it internally support the ability to know which artifacts are super old.\r\n\r\nCurrently I'd recommend using something like `sccache` for CI instead of caching the entire `target` folder in the meantime, but work on this would definitely be appreciated!"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/comments/413520622", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5885#issuecomment-413520622", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5885", "id": 413520622, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMzUyMDYyMg==", "user": {"login": "thomaseizinger", "id": 5486389, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODYzODk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5486389?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomaseizinger", "html_url": "https://github.com/thomaseizinger", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomaseizinger/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomaseizinger/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomaseizinger/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomaseizinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomaseizinger/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomaseizinger/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomaseizinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomaseizinger/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thomaseizinger/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2018-08-16T11:57:01Z", "updated_at": "2018-08-16T11:57:01Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "Thanks for the quick answer!\r\nWe are using sccache now which helps already quite a bit!"}]
