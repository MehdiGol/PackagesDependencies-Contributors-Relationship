binaries to `/usr/lib/cargo/bin` and then symlink them into `/usr/bin` unless there is a conflict like the `fd` case. Then if people want to call `fd` in cross-platform shell scripts they can just `export PATH=/usr/lib/cargo/bin:$PATH` at the top of their shell scripts rather than some complex if-statement involving `fd`/`fdfind`.\r\n\r\nPlease take this issue seriously rather than downvoting me without explanation.\r\n"}]
