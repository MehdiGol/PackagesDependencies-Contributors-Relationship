I *think* what's being proposed is adding a `.cargo/config` file when projects are created with `cargo new` which specifies the default registry for this project. That sounds fine, but I'd prefer it *only* create that file if you pass `--registry`, and the behavior of `cargo new` without `--registry` doesn't change."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/comments/427378830", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6123#issuecomment-427378830", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6123", "id": 427378830, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzM3ODgzMA==", "user": {"login": "cswindle", "id": 16157454, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTU3NDU0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/16157454?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cswindle", "html_url": "https://github.com/cswindle", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cswindle/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cswindle/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cswindle/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cswindle/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cswindle/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cswindle/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cswindle/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cswindle/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cswindle/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2018-10-05T14:09:26Z", "updated_at": "2018-10-05T14:09:26Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "No, it is setting the publish field in Cargo.toml based on if you pass --registry.
