It's essentially the same as mentioned in #6143.  Cargo tries to keep track of what is needed to be built for the host vs the target (for cross-compiling), and build scripts, their dependencies, compiler plugins, etc. all get lumped together as host-specific things all for the purpose of making sure `--panic` is set correctly (it's convoluted). \r\n\r\nI know how to fix this, it shouldn't be too difficult.  It's just that the fix might cause some things to be built multiple times when they previously weren't (specifically when you set `panic = \"abort\"`), and I'm a little uncertain if that extra compile time will be a problem for other users.  (cc #5445)\r\n\r\nI'll try to tinker with it sometime soon and see what the implications are."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/comments/427683635", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6154#issuecomment-427683635", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6154", "id": 427683635, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzY4MzYzNQ==", "user": {"login": "crumblingstatue", "id": 1521976, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjE5NzY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1521976?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/crumblingstatue", "html_url": "https://github.com/crumblingstatue", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crumblingstatue/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crumblingstatue/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crumblingstatue/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crumblingstatue/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crumblingstatue/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crumblingstatue/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crumblingstatue/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crumblingstatue/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/crumblingstatue/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2018-10-07T20:18:45Z", "updated_at": "2018-10-07T20:18:45Z", "author_association": "NONE", "body": "> It's just that the fix might cause some things to be built multiple times when they previously weren't (specifically when you set panic = \"abort\"), and I'm a little uncertain if that extra compile time will be a problem for other users\r\n\r\nWell, this issue is specifically a problem **because** of the extra compile time it causes.
