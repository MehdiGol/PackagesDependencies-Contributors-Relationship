People working on Leaf do not need to know anything about Carrot, the decision is to split Leaf to separate repo so it can live its own life, however Carrot still want to have path-system-like dependency on Leaf allowing for much easier and seamless work.\r\n\r\nAnother motivation is a reverse one. \r\nI start working on Carrot, but i am also working on a library that is now a separate repo. the work between Carrot and the Library is so close, that I want to have them on the same tree. Also this eases up debugging, workspaces are great for debugging, having symbols under one tree gives me access to everything.\r\n\r\nYes, I do know that you can use submodules for this, because its simply nothing but a path dependency but you need to invoke the `git submodule init`. However, I have not tested this, but can you depend on a library that has  workspace one of project in that workspace is a submodule? Will that work?\r\nI am sorry but I didnt get to test it yet, I will :) "}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/comments/422965890", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6041#issuecomment-422965890", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6041", "id": 422965890, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMjk2NTg5MA==", "user": {"login": "ehuss", "id": 43198, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTk4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/43198?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss", "html_url": "https://github.com/ehuss", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ehuss/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2018-09-19T21:32:21Z", "updated_at": "2018-09-19T21:32:21Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "I'm not sure if I understand your question.
