In any case seems fine to discuss here!\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the version of `cargo`-the-library that `cargo outdated` is using thinks that to use the `edition` key you need to have the `edition` feature listed. The `enable_nightly_features` function is not intended to solve this, it's a red herring.\r\n\r\nThe beta channel of Cargo is different source code than what's published on crates.io, only the stable channel's `cargo`-as-a-library is published. The beta channel Cargo doesn't require the `edition` feature to use the `edition` key. The stable channel, however, does.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a problem purely isolated to `cargo oudated`, though. Any subcommand that links to `cargo`-the-library will likely experience this. I think the best thing we can do is to add a specific function which is targeted at relaxing the restriction that nightly features need to be listed to use them. This function would never be called by `cargo`-the-binary itself. It would, however, relax the restriction that features need to be explicitly enabled.\r\n\r\nThis won't be a bulletproof solution but it would hopefully be a better solution than what we have now! For the time being there's unfortunately not a great solution otherwise that I know of :("}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/comments/425731956", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6113#issuecomment-425731956", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6113", "id": 425731956, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTczMTk1Ng==", "user": {"login": "joelgallant", "id": 1429994, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mjk5OTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1429994?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/joelgallant", "html_url": "https://github.com/joelgallant", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joelgallant/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joelgallant/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joelgallant/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joelgallant/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joelgallant/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joelgallant/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joelgallant/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joelgallant/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/joelgallant/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2018-09-30T16:13:13Z", "updated_at": "2018-09-30T16:13:13Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "body": "See https://github.com/kbknapp/cargo-outdated/issues/141 which is relevant, specifically cargo-outdated needs to carry the `cargo-features` into it's `Manifest` struct and deserialize with it, since cargo the library requires it."}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/comments/425986229", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6113#issuecomment-425986229", "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6113", "id": 425986229, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTk4NjIyOQ==", "user": {"login": "alexcrichton", "id": 64996, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/64996?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton", "html_url": "https://github.com/alexcrichton", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/alexcrichton/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "created_at": "2018-10-01T17:08:08Z", "updated_at": "2018-10-01T17:08:08Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "body": "@joelgallant I believe that's the same issue as this one, which should be solved by my above comment"}]
