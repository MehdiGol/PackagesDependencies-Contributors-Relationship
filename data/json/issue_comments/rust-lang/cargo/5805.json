It is a performance optimization to not even look at the filesystem for these crates on incremental builds.\r\n\r\nThe correct way to modify a vendored crate is to use `[patch]` or a `path` dependency, and Cargo will then correctly handle the crate on incremental rebuilds as it knows that it's not a readonly dependency."}]
